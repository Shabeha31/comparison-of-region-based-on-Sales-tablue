## Comparison of Region Based on Sales

 ## Project Description

 This interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the sales comparison between two selected regions. The key goals were to: 
 - Compare sales performance between two selected regions using interactive visualizations
 - Build a dynamic Tableau dashboard to support data-driven decision making
 - Enable region-wise comparison through user-controlled parameters (Primary & Secondary Region)
 - Analyze key business metrics
 - Implement hierarchies to represent location-based data effectively
 - Use calculated fields to derive meaningful insights from raw sales data
 - Provide management with a clear, visual understanding of regional performance

Key visualizations include:

- Side-by-side comparison of Primary Region and Secondary Region for easy performance analysis
- Filled maps highlighting selected regions to provide geographic context for sales performance
- KPI Summary Cards (First Order Date, Total Sales, Average Sales per Order, Number of Customers, Number of Orders, Number of Products Sold)
- Tabular breakdown of sales by product sub-category for each region
- Mini line charts showing sales trends over time for each sub-category
- Enables quick identification of top- and low-performing product categories
- Symmetrical dashboard layout to ensure consistent and intuitive region-to-region comparison

 ## Project Description

 This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze used car sales data. The key goals were to:

- Provide insights into sales trends over time
- Compare performance by transmission, fuel type, ownership etc.
- Analyze sales and pricing by different car segments
- Identify relationships between mileage, age and pricing
- Enable data-driven decision making for inventory, pricing and marketing

The dashboard combines used car listing data from various sources. It allows slicing and dicing - the data by relevant dimensions using filters and parameters.

Key visualizations include:

- Sales price trends over time
- Analysis of average pricing, mileage by fuel type, transmission
- Used car volume by dealer type, owner types
- Correlation analysis between pricing factors
- Forecasting of future pricing based on trends

 ## Project Description

 This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze call center data. The key goals were to:

- Provide insights into call volume, sentiment, and complaint types
- Identify trends in response time and service level adherence
- Compare performance across different channels and locations
- Enable data-driven decision making for call center operations

The dashboard combines data from call logs, transcripts, surveys, and other sources. It utilizes various charts, metrics, and filters to slice the data by relevant dimensions.

Key visualizations include:

- Call volume and sentiment breakdowns
- Analysis of call drivers by most common complaint reasons
- Response time analysis against service level agreements
- Call center volume and performance by location
- Channel analysis comparing call center, email, chat, and web
