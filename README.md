## Comparison of Region Based on Sales

 ## Project Description

 This interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the sales comparison between two selected regions. The key goals were to: 
 - Compare sales performance between two selected regions using interactive visualizations
 - Build a dynamic Tableau dashboard to support data-driven decision making
 - Enable region-wise comparison through user-controlled parameters (Primary & Secondary Region)
 - Analyze key business metrics
 - Implement hierarchies to represent location-based data effectively
 - Use calculated fields to derive meaningful insights from raw sales data
 - Provide management with a clear, visual understanding of regional performance

Key visualizations include:

- Side-by-side comparison of Primary Region and Secondary Region for easy performance analysis
- Filled maps highlighting selected regions to provide geographic context for sales performance
- KPI Summary Cards (First Order Date, Total Sales, Average Sales per Order, Number of Customers, Number of Orders, Number of Products Sold)
- Tabular breakdown of sales by product sub-category for each region
- Mini line charts showing sales trends over time for each sub-category
- Enables quick identification of top- and low-performing product categories
- Symmetrical dashboard layout to ensure consistent and intuitive region-to-region comparison
